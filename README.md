**Hi, Iâ€™m Roy Krishnan. I've worked in Data Science, Sports Science & Biomechanics Departments, in the NBA & around the MLB. 
Currently I'm on sabbatical from professional sports & serving as the CEO & engineering lead of my startup [Liquid Sports Lab](https://liquidsportslab.com) .** 

**Recent Recognitions:** 
- [2024 Front Office Rising 25 Winner](https://frontofficesports.com/rising-25-2024-winners/) 
- [2024 The Peak Emerging Leader Winner](https://readthepeak.com/lists/emerging-leaders-2024/c/sports) 

Projects I'm currently working on: 
- DS5 (Dynamic Start/Sit Sports Scoring System):
  - Purpose: A better way to manage strain & stress in professional athletics utilizing in-game biomechanics data, every day CNS testing, & wearable technology to create fatigue matrices & correponding predictive outputs of risk & performance.
  - The goal: Create a better public load management system that than simply minutes played/pitches thrown.

Finished:
- CompScore+: A markerless biomechanics scoring system used to replace marker based technology in order to create a better lab environment stimulus for baseball pitchers.
  - Licensed to Driveline Baseball Enterprises. 
- HERO: A similarity scoring algorithm comparing relevant kinematics and kinetics to provide MLB equivalents for non-mlb clientele using regressed medians by level & Euclidean distances to group  players by how similar their mechanics & arsenal profile.
  - Licensed to Epic Sports Biomechanics.
